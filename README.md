The provided Move contract implements a simple tipping system on the Aptos Blockchain with only two functions.

Module Name:
text
module MyModule::Tipping
A module in Move is like a smart contract—contains your logic and resources.

MyModule is the named address where this contract will be deployed.

Tipping is the contract’s name.

Struct:
text
struct TipBox has key, store {
    total_received: u64,
}
TipBox is a resource stored in a user’s account to track how much they have received in tips.

total_received stores the total number of AptosCoins the user has received.

has key means it can be stored in user accounts.

has store means it can store other values.

Function 1 — initialize_tipbox
text
public fun initialize_tipbox(account: &signer) {
    move_to(account, TipBox { total_received: 0 });
}
Creates and stores a TipBox in the user’s account.

Must be called before a user can receive tips.

Sets total_received to 0 initially.

Function 2 — send_tip
text
public fun send_tip(sender: &signer, recipient: address, amount: u64) acquires TipBox {
    let tip = coin::withdraw<AptosCoin>(sender, amount);
    coin::deposit<AptosCoin>(recipient, tip);

    let tipbox = borrow_global_mut<TipBox>(recipient);
    tipbox.total_received = tipbox.total_received + amount;
}
Sends AptosCoin from the sender to the recipient.

coin::withdraw deducts coins from sender.

coin::deposit transfers coins to the recipient’s account.

Updates the recipient’s total_received count in their TipBox.

acquires TipBox means this function will read and modify the recipient's TipBox resource.

Key Points:
Only two functions:

One to initialize (register tip receiver).

One to send tips + track the total received.

Uses AptosCoin from aptos_framework.

Tracks tips on-chain without external databases.

Code is short (~40 lines) and easy to extend.

If you want, I can also create a flow diagram that visually shows how the tip process works between sender and receiver.
